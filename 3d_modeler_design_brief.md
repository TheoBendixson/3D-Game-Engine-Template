## Gameplay

My basic idea for this game is "What if you took the main mechanic from Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, and you went deeper with it?"

In that game, Link has the ability to merge himself into walls. He becomes a flattened version of himself, projected onto the surface of any walls he can merge into.

Like most Zelda games, the mechanic itself is very appealing, but it's mostly used for exploration, and the true depth of it remains untraversed.

In my puzzle game, I want to ask some new questions.

What if you can merge 3D objects into the walls, say a pushable block? 
What if you can push flattened blocks in 2D while being merged into the walls?
What happens if you merge an asymmetrical 3D object onto the suface of a wall, push it around a corner, and then pull it back out? (It rotates).

And so on...

A few thoughts on visual design:
We clearly aren't going for realism. We could use relatively few polygons/pixels (like Stephen's Sausage Roll) and still get most of the gameplay ideas across. If it's a viable game idea, we can do another pass on 3D models / textures to give it an amazing look.

The main player character needs to be designed in 3D and 2D at the same time. The "merged" version needs to look plausibly like the 3D model but flattened onto a surface (even if stylized). So always be thinking about the 2D character when working on the 3D character.
